# ionic-codepen-deploy
This is a tiny shell script that downloads Ionic codepen projects and creates Ionic apps out of them.

It will then add each project to whatever phone that's plugged in, to expidite the process, you may wish to supply
`android` or `ios` as the only arguement. 

Running the script after the codePens directory already exists, will add the apps to whatever phone is plugged in,
skipping adding new projects.
